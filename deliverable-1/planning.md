## Product Details

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

> Short (1 - 2 min' read)

Our team is working with Techfugees Totonto to build an Android mobile app for refugees that facilitates the housing search process for refugees and establishes a better mutual understanding and support between refugees, outreach workers, and housing provides.

In Toronto, only about half of refugees who have gone through the city’s shelter system in the past two years have been settled into permanent housing. Additionally, Toronto’s shelter system is operating at nearly 100% capacity. 40% of people staying in Toronto shelters are refugees.

The existing services that assist refugees in their housing services are limited due to chronic understaffing of outreach workers in the shelter system. Additionally, refugees are often subject to discrimiation by housing providers due to xenophobia or unfair cultural or social biases.

The goal of this app is to give refugees exposure to a network of "friendly" housing providers while maintaining accessibility such as ease of access (Android dominates the mobile OS market share) and offline features, such as GPS mapping.

A mock-up of the app can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/file/5FJnnTRoEI6RslFVcAAJXs/Techfugees-Mobile-App?node-id=0%3A1)

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

> Short (1 - 2 min' read)

- Be specific (e.g. a 'a third-year university student studying Computer Science' and not 'a student')
- **Feel free to use personas. You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).**

#### Refugees seeking Housing

Refugees seeking asylum, including government sponsored refugees. Their main goal is to get settled into permanent housing. An obstacle that many refugees face is discrimination from landlords when trying to rent. Due to a lack of existing services, many refugees are forced to rely on outreach workers and their local shelter system which are often understaffed and running at full capacity.

#### Outreach Workers

Outreach workers at settlement organizations, who's primary responsibility is to act as a liason between the refugee community and their network of friendly landlords. They are often understaffed and face a large volume of incoming requests, which can make it hard to connect all the refugees they handle with stable housing.

#### Landlords

Landlords in the Toronto area. Their primary goal is to rent out their property. Their biggest obstacle is finding tenants who they want to lease to. They may deny a tenant based on not having credit history, or those who are short on first and last month rent.

#### Friendly Landlords

Landlords in the Toronto area who have helped in the past with refugee support. Their primary goal is to rent out their property. Their biggest obstacle is getting in contact with tenants.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

> Short (1 - 2 min' read)

- We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
- Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
  - Save users time (how much?)
  - Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
  - Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)
  - Does this application exist in another form? If so, how does your differ and provide value to the users?
  - How does this align with your partner's organization's values/mission/mandate?

Since our app would build a network between refugees, outreach workers and housing providers, it'll help refugee tenants access lists of available housings, in addition to allowing search by location, landlord, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, type of building, etc. This helps refugees save time and effort in their search for suitable rentals. 
For a future tenant to obtain all this info on an apartment would take a lot of research, all of which has to be done through the internet on a relatively long span of time. Refugees do not have this luxury, and our app aims to solve that. Our Partner's mission is to support the inclusion of displaced people. And through this app, help refugees specifically in finding better housing for themselves.


#### Q4: How will you build it?

> Short (1-2 min' read max)

- What is the technology stack? Specify any and all languages, frameworks, libraries, PaaS products or tools.
- How will you deploy the application?
- Describe the architecture - what are the high level components or patterns you will use? Diagrams are useful here.
- Will you be using third party applications or APIs? If so, what are they?
- What is your testing strategy?

We'll do an android app, using android studio.


#### Q5: What are the user stories that make up the MVP?

- At least 5 user stories concerning the main features of the application - note that this can broken down further
- You must follow proper user story format (as taught in lecture) `As a <user of the app>, I want to <do something in the app> in order to <accomplish some goal>`
- User stories must contain acceptance criteria. Examples of user stories with different formats can be found here: https://www.justinmind.com/blog/user-story-examples/. **It is important that you provide a link to an artifact containing your user stories**.
- If you have a partner, these must be reviewed and accepted by them

- As a Refugees seeking Housing, I want to find some friendly landlords in order to find a house that is more convenient for me.
- As a Landlords, I want to find reassuring tenants in order to keep my house clean and good.
- As a Friendly Landlords, I want to find good Refugees in order to help them and keep my house clean.
- As a Refugees, I want to find a house by the number of bedrooms in order to find a house that suits my family.
- As a Refugees, I want to find a place to live by type of build in order to find a place with economic price.

## Intellectual Property Confidentiality Agreement

> Note this section is **not marked** but must be completed briefly if you have a partner. If you have any questions, please contact David and Adam.
>
> **By default, you own any work that you do as part of your coursework.** However, some partners may want you to keep the project confidential after the course is complete. As part of your first deliverable, you should discuss and agree upon an option with your partner. Examples include:

1. You can share the software and the code freely with anyone with or without a license, regardless of domain, for any use.
2. You can upload the code to GitHub or other similar publicly available domains.
3. You will only share the code under an open-source license with the partner but agree to not distribute it in any way to any other entity or individual.
4. You will share the code under an open-source license and distribute it as you wish but only the partner can access the system deployed during the course.

**Briefly describe which option you have agreed to. Your partner cannot ask you to sign any legally binding agreements or documents pertaining to non-disclosure, confidentiality, IP ownership, etc.**

## Process Details

#### Q6: What are the roles & responsibilities on the team?

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

- Roles should reflect the structure of your team and be appropriate for your project. Not necessarily one role to one team member.

List each team member and:

- A description of their role(s) and responsibilities including the components they'll work on and non-software related work
- 3 technical strengths and weaknesses each (e.g. languages, frameworks, libraries, development methodologies, etc.)

#### Q7: What operational events will you have as a team?

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have.

- When and where? Recurring or ad hoc? In-person or online?
- What's the purpose of each meeting?
- Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync meeting online, etc.
- You must have at least 2 meetings with your project partner (if you have one) before D1 is due. Describe them here:
  - What did you discuss during the meetings?
  - What were the outcomes of each meeting?
  - You must provide meeting minutes.
  - You must have a regular meeting schedule established by the second meeting.
  
We'll use discord for organizing any meetings. Any meetings will usually be ad-hoc unless a deadline is coming up, or something that needs more than just chatting. Everything will be online only. 
Each meeting will have its own purpose. But in general, we'll have meetings to ensure everyone is on the same page, if that can't be done in writing, and also to make sure everything is in working order before presenting something to our partner or the instructors’ team.
We did two meetings. One after getting assigned to our partner, and one where we reviewed D1. 
In the first meeting, which took roughly one hour from 1:00pm to 2:00pm on Sunday February 7th, we agreed that our app would mainly be on android, and it would be best if it could function as much as possible offline.


#### Q8: What artifacts will you use to self-organize?

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.

- Artifacts can be To-Do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), meeting minutes, etc.
- We want to understand:
  - How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
  - **How do you prioritize tasks?**
  - How do tasks get assigned to team members?
  - How do you determine the status of work from inception to completion?

#### Trello

We will be using Trello as both a To-Do list, and to keep track of ongoing tasks. Tasks will have a priority level based on deadline and how dependant other features are on the task. Appropriate deadlines for tasks will be discussed amongst team during weekly bilats. Team members can self-assign to tasks they find interesting/align with their area of expertise in order of priority. If a team member is not assigned to an ongoing task, other members can request for additional help.

#### Discord

Our primary platform for communication between team members will be discord. This is where we will host our weekly-bilats, and where we can post questions/provide resources to eachother. We will create channels for general chat, session-planning, tech resources, and meeting minutes.

#### Slack

We will be using slack to communicate with the client.

#### Q9: What are the rules regarding how your team works?

Describe your team's working culture.

**Communications:**

- What is the expected frequency? What methods/channels are appropriate?
- If you have a partner project, what is your process (in detail) for communicating with your partner?

**Meetings:**

- How are people held accountable for attending meetings, completing action items? Is there a moderator or process?

**Conflict Resolution:**

- List at least three team scenarios/conflicts you discussed in lecture and how you decided you will resolve them. Indecisions? Non-responsive team members? Any other scenarios you can think of?
