# Techfugees Rental App/Team-project-13-techfugees-toronto

> _Note:_ This document is intended to be relatively short. Be concise and precise. Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of your application and is non-technical. 

## Description 
 * Provide a high-level description of your application and it's value from an end-user's perspective
 * What is the problem you're trying to solve?
 * Is there any context required to understand **why** the application solves this problem?

A web application called Techfugees Toronto. A website made for refugees to facilitate their housing search process.
Only half the refugees who went through Toronto's shelter system have been settled into permanent housings in the last two years. And there are many more who can't find suitable housing. 
This website allows landlords to post housing listings aimed for refugees, with in depth specification of every listing, in addition to user reviews.

## Key Features
 * Described the key features in the application that the user can access
 * Provide a breakdown or detail for each feature that is most appropriate for your application
 * This section will be used to assess the value of the features built

Landlords signup to post property listings with pictures and basic information like location, number of rooms, etc. 
Refugees can sign up to view housings, search through them by number of bedrooms, bathrooms, building type, reviews, landlord's name and reviews. 
The website allows wish listing properties as well.

## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described above
 * This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully
 
 ## Development requirements
 * If a developer were to set this up on their machine or a remote server, what are the technical requirements (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 * Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application (think a true README).
 
 ## Deployment and GitHub Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live application
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and how
 * Don't forget to **briefly explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

We used GitHub Actions to automatically run the test scripts for flask, our backend framework. 
On any push or merge, the workflow is run to make sure the newly added files don't break compatibility. 
Merges from branches were regularly reviewed by Andi Fan and Kim Le.
Whenever a new feature was being worked on, a new branch was created for it. After making sure it's working correctly, it gets merged back into main, our stable branch.
We used GitHub Actions for convenience, since it's already on GitHub. It also has templates for workflows and auto suggests them based on the repoâ€™s files.

 ## Licenses 

 Keep this section as brief as possible. You may read this [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) for a start.

 * What type of license will you apply to your codebase?
 * What affect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?
 * Why did you or your partner make this choice?
